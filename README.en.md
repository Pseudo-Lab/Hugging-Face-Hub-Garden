> Welcome to Hugging Face Hub Garden repository! We aim to cultivate a vibrant AI development community, offering tools and frameworks for dataset creation, model fine-tuning, and knowledge sharing. Join us in advancing the field of Korean language AI through open collaboration and innovation!

## üåü Project Vision
<h3 align="center"> "An AI Hub Garden Filled with Data and Models for Everyone" </h3>

The **Hugging Face Hub Garden** project is a journey that goes beyond simply building datasets - it's about experiencing the process of **creating your own resources and sharing them with the world**.

In this project, we aim to **design our own datasets, find optimal models for fine-tuning, and upload them to the Hugging Face Hub**. Through **collaboratively thinking about, experimenting with, and improving** dataset construction and model optimization - tasks that can be challenging to tackle alone - we can gain deeper insights.

From data collection to refinement, applying various fine-tuning techniques, performance evaluation, and dataset improvement‚Äîthis will be an opportunity to **experience the entire process firsthand and grow from learners into creators**.

Shall we cultivate our hub garden together? üåø‚ú®
